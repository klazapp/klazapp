Hello! I am Klaus and I am a mobile game developer with experience in C# and Unity.
I am incredibly passionate about making games and am constantly coming up with new game ideas to develop.
I have singlehandedly prototyped, developed, and published close to 20 apps on both iOS and GooglePlay app stores.
